# Discord-MusicBot

## ü§ñ Typescript Discord Music Bot

See Original Source, there is a new Version with more features and a Web Interface

I will split from the Original because I don't want Lavalink, Webinterface and the other stuff

This will cause less updates because I am alone but feel free to open Pull Requests, Issues and Feature Requests

## üíª First Start

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`  
Insert Token and a Prefix of your choice
Change Presence to your desire. This will be the "Activity" your bot is doing

## üîó Invite

```txt
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your_client_id>&permissions=2205280320&scope=applications.commands%20bot
```

Replace `your_client_id` with your client id from your Discord Application

# discordjs

See Original Source, there is a new Version with more features and a Web Interface3

I will split from the Original because I don't want Lavalink, Webinterface and other stuff

This will cause less updates because I am alone, feel free to open Pull Requests, Issues and Feature Requests

## First Start

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`  
Insert Token and a Prefix of your choice
Change Presence to your desire. This will be the "Activity" your bot is doing

## Invite

```txt
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your_client_id>&permissions=3271744&scope=bot
```

Replace your_client_id with your client id from your Discord Application

## Todo

- [ ] Discord Slash Commands (==discord.js@13)
- [ ] Spotify Support
- [ ] ?Permissions
- [ ] Convert to Typescript

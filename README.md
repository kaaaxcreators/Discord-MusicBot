# discordjs

See Original Source, there is a new Version with more features and a Web Interface3

I will split from the Original because I don't want Lavalink, Webinterface and other stuff

This will cause less updates because I am alone, feel free to open Pull Requests, Issues and Feature Requests

Todo:

- [ ] Earrape
- [ ] Discord Slash Commands
- [ ] Spotify Support
- [ ] ?Permissions
- [ ] Workflows, Tests, Dependabot

Future:

- [ ] Convert to Typescript

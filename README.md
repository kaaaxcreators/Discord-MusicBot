## ¬©Ô∏è Credits

This Bot / Repo is not a fork but heavily inspired from [SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot).
I didn't like the move to Lavalink which adds an unnecessary dependency, because you need a server which hosts Lavalink and not everyone wants to. Through my approach that the client handles all music, it sometimes hangs or lags shortly but not really noticeable
